"But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the ""logical"" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and ""make sense"" to more than one person, these specific ""explanations"" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.",0

You should have guessed it- those rats reproduce, and the others don't (as much).   Another: elephants use their tusks on predators and for ritual purposes (attracting mates). Some elephants lack tusks or have shorter tusks.   However, when poachers kill the elephants with the biggest tusks, the elephants with smaller tusks (or no tusks) reproduce more.",0

The scary part of this insane reality is that there are a LOT of whackos that think just like and actually support Pat Robertson. And I would venture to say that 98% of them who voted, voted for Bush. Ha! There's one born every minute.

"i think your post brings up a good point, and that's that to discuss torture, there needs to be a good understanding of what constitutes torture.  what are we talking about, exactly? just listening to loud music? loud music at 125 db 24/7 resulting in sleep deprivation? physical torture? or how about humiliation, like forced nakedness? simple prisoner punishment? having to eat a different diet? i think some things could be torture and some not, depending on the person being tortured, as well. it's a complicated subject--too complicated just to throw out some all-inclusive word like 'torture' and be able to adequately discuss it.",0

Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.,0
The situation has nothing to do with chance. People don't have to draw cards to figure out who is going to have to kill themselves.,0
So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.,1
"What study do you refer to? If you're going to bring up something then you should be ready to provide it whenever you try and make a point.

And who are they more likely to get murdered in comparison to? Are they more likely than people who live in the ghettos? More likely than drug dealers? More likely than gang members? More likely than police officers? More likely than people in third world countries? Who exactly?",0

"Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will.
