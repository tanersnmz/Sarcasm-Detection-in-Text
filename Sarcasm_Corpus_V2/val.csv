"I admit I didn't know who Sermonti was at first. A search on Wikipedia returned Ciacco, one of the characters of the Divine Comedy by Dante. a Google search led me to Giuseppe Sermonti who has written against evolution since 1980. He is known for expressing the need for 'purpose' to be part of science, giving such examples as: ""In the presence of the inducer (lactose) the cell produces an enzyme with the purpose of utilizing lactose4)."" In case you never took biochemistry, this is an incredibly well understood chemical process and requires no purpose beyond the interaction of well understood chemicals.",0

"Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.",0

As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it.

"Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?",0

The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone.

it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.,0

I still do not understand what these people are demonstrating for or against. Are they demonstarting for being dropped in the middle of cancer treatement?

Do you know how the rest of the song goes? Did Willie Nelson write it?There are many song lyrics that suggest something that are either not true for the singer or not even ment to mean that by the singer. How do you know for a fact that he's not singing about a woman? The lyrics aren't saying ,0
