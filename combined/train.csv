But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.,0

One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.",0

What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).",0

There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most?

"The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. ",0

"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.",0

"""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering.

Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal.

You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.

Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'.

No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough.

The ""white morph"" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the ""matter of months"" that you state), and that isn't evolution.

Interesting thought..... such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender (ie. the pro-life religious male) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral/philosophical considerations alone.

In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty.

"After. Christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent. It arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century. From one follower of a 7th Day Adventist prophetess came ""flood geology"" in the early 20th century. Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern ""creation science."" It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.   Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible. When creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur, they decided that God had created original ""kinds"" and then allow hyper evolution after that. Creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind.",0

The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies.",0

The question is illogical. By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible. See another thread for that topic.   The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature. To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.,0

Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?,0

If they are assured that their children will live to adulthood, people won't feel the need to have large families to ensure that at least some of them will survive.   Also, religions that demean women and forbid contraception should be restrained from determining public policy.",0

More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid.

I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much.

You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.",0

Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves.",0

it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.,0

Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.",0

Matthew S. Stated that when people say ""We believe marriage is between a man and a woman."" think that gays are not citizens. I then returned a question saying ""if someone if 6 and can't marry are they going to 'not be citizens' as well?"". The logic behind that question is not to say that gays are 6 year olds but rather that gays are citizens just like a 6 yr old even if both can't marry. In other words, marriage doesn't make you a citizen or not...unless you think 6yr olds are citizens as well.

"[quote=Galileo]Congress has justified its regulation of guns based on the Commerce Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constitution.   [quote]   You mean this one?   According to dictionary.com:   commerce ( P ) Pronunciation Key (kmrs)   n.   1. The buying and selling of goods, especially on a large scale, as between cities or nations. See Synonyms at business.   2. Intellectual exchange or social interaction.   3. Sexual intercourse.   While I really hope it doesn't refer to #3 and I doubt it means #2, I would think it means #1.   So it can regulate buying and selling among the states, with foreign countries, and with Indian tribes. So as long as it is sold in the state, the federal government has no power to regulate it. I always thought it was just the states that did that, but the 2nd amendment stops them from doing that. Or so I thought.",0
"No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean ""wild guess with no foundation"". That seems to be what you want the word to mean. In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested. You see, a theory is predictive. I'll give you some examples of scientific theories. The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.   Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life. It is done all the time. While it may be debatable that a virus is alive, the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution.",0

Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.",0

"Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.",0

Someone else once said, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings"".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - ""The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience).

In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology. ",0

My Lord simone, a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby. But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution.

"I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.",0

For this reason any method of contraception poses the same threat to them as abortion does, though some methods may be easier to rally support against than others.",0
