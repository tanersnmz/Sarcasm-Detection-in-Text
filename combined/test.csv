I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime. ",0
"Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically.

"Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.",0

In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty.

"You do realize that Poplowski got an offical Dishonorable Discharge from the Marine Corps? In other words, that gun was not legally owned.

I remember a town I lived in where four murders happened in one week. Of course, the liberals scream ""*gasp*, four murders! Everybody's going insane! We gotta ban guns! Aaaahh!!"". However, none of these murders were committed with a firearm, and it was later found out that these killings were committed by one person. It's an isolated incident.

But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional.",1

Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers. Now, its the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human's experience.",0

"Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone ""up there"" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify.

"Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.",0

Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.",0

A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps.

The ""white morph"" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the ""matter of months"" that you state), and that isn't evolution.

Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. ",0
